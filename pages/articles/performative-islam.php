        <h3>The Theatre of Muslim Social Media</h3>
          <p class="pages">My reason for posting this video is mainly twofold:</p>
          <p class="pages">One, for Daniel Haqiqatjou: take a good look in the mirror and put aside this Ali G-like persona you’ve become and come back to reality.</p>
          <p class="pages">Two, for others: beware of those who make startling transformations right before your eyes.</p>
          <p>Such individuals are not well and I do not mean “mental health”: the heart is disturbed. When they can don a new costume and force the world into an artificial one-dimensional fantasy in which they have cast themselves are the underdog reluctant hero in their own play, a play Shakespeare himself would have been proud of, full of betrayal and intrigue, then know that such a transformation is as fake, and dramatized!, as a three dollar bill.</p>
          <p>Here’s the Muslim Septic back in July 2015 chillin’ with all the "deviant Muslims" at my house for Eid.</p>

        <p class="pages">I have prepared a few videos discussing the phenomenon of what I call <strong>performative Islam</strong> in that I have observed over time the shift from <em>practicing Islam</em>, as a means of describing and embodying piety, to where it is <em>performed</em> for an audience. This, I feel, is most so with those who've become Muslim, especially those in positions of leadership.</p>
